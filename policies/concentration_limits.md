## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes concentration limits to prevent excessive exposure to any single security, issuer, sector, or geographic region. These limits protect the Fund from idiosyncratic risks and ensure portfolio diversification consistent with our investment mandate.

An "issuer" is defined as:
- A single corporate entity and all of its subsidiaries
- All securities of a corporate family (common stock, preferred, bonds)
- Parent company exposure includes proportional subsidiary exposure

### 3.2 Calculation Methodology
